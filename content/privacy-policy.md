**3. How we use your personal data**

We will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
- Where we need to perform agreements, we are about to enter or have entered with you, e.g., the Terms of Service for NFT purchase service and others.
- Where you have consented before the processing e.g. newsletter you subscribe for.

**4. Retention of personal data**

We retain personal data in an identifiable format for the least amount of time necessary to fulfill our legal or regulatory obligations and for our business purposes (in general, for up to 3 years after the termination of the relationship). In the case of KYC/CDD we keep the data for 5 years. For accounting purposes, we keep the transactional data for 7 years.

If our agreement is terminated, we reserve our right to retain and access the data for so long as required to comply with applicable laws. We will continue to use and disclose such personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.

Once the period of retaining your personal data is over, we will delete, or anonymize your personal data. The data which is anonymized (irrevocably detached from you) may be used for our internal purposes.

To use or ask to use our service, including to process your transactions, we may disclose your personal data to third-parties such as financial institutions, third party reference agencies, payment processing providers, data verification service providers, shipping and logistics couriers, warehouses and/or other partners in due course of fulfillment of our agreement with you or on order to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.

We will also disclose your personal data to other third parties including: regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, non-affiliated third parties for payments processing, payments, sales, data analysis, research and surveys, and/or professional advisors such as tax or legal advisors, consultants and accountants.

**6. International transfers**

We are an EU-based company. Your personal data may be processed, transferred to, and maintained on servers and databases located within EU and elsewhere where the privacy laws may not be as protective as your jurisdiction. If we need to transfer your personal data to and from any state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction we will ensure that transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization are subject to appropriate safeguards (for example by Standard Contractual Clauses).

**7. Automatic processing**

If we make a decision to provide marketing information based on profile analysis, your personal preferences, or possible patterns of behavior are assessed or predicted and can be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You have a right to reject such profiling and we will stop sending you profiled marketing messages.

**8. Your legal rights**

You have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to:

- **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a data subject access request). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
- **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
- **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information without compelling legal grounds, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
- **Object to processing** your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest, and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.

In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information, which override your rights and freedoms.
- Request **restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:

	a. if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
	b. where our use of the data is without compelling legal grounds but you do not want us to erase it;
	c. where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or 
	d. you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
	e. you may prohibit the processing of the personal data for direct marketing purposes as well as to refuse the advertisements and offers at any time by informing us thereof.
- **the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information, which you initially provided for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
- **consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.

You can exercise any of these rights at any time by contacting us.

We reserve the right to decline your request to exercise any of the rights under this section if we are not legally obligated to provide such rights under the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence.

You have a right to lodge a complaint to the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate (e-mail address: [info@aki.ee](mailto:info@aki.ee); telephone: +372 5620 2341 or +372 627 4135; address: Tatari 39, Tallinn 10134, Estonia) if you consider that processing of your personal data infringes your rights and interests under the law.
