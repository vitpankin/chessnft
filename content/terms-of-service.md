**6. Placing orders and payment**

NFT(s) can be ordered at the Chess NFT Marketplace by clicking the order button. Please check the accuracy of the provided data during the order.

The price and availability of NFT may change at any time and without prior notice. If you have placed the order before the price changes, the price valid at the time of the order shall apply. The Company may also apply quantity limitations on orders at its sole discretion.

The prices for an initial market are listed in United States dollars, Ether (ETH) and/or Everscale (EVER, former TON) cryptocurrencies. The Company does not provide a fiat payment service for the secondary NFT market.

The Company accepts Visa, Mastercard and other payment methods for fiat payments (USD) and base cryptocurrencies as an alternative payment method. The list of available payment methods, cryptocurrencies and supported Everscale wallets are displayed on the Chess NFT Marketplace.

The price of NFT in cryptocurrencies depends on the market price of these cryptocurrencies at the time of your payment.

If the payment of a due amount is not received or in case of irregular payment, the Company reserves the right, after taking your order, to suspend or cancel the order.

Acceptance by us of an order for an NFT purchase does not guarantee that you will receive the NFT. The NFT purchase is conditional upon actual receipt by us of the funds from your credit card or the specified amount of cryptocurrency, as well as payment of any applicable fees.

Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain, the NFT can be bought by another Customer between when you have submitted an order for the NFT purchase and debit your card or get cryptocurrency payment. In this case, the funds or assets will be returned to you.
